How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  There are numerous methods to ensure my software is functional and secure. One main method is to think through every line of code while running, and do peer code reviews or step through the code by myself to ensure I understand why I put in each line, and why it is necessary. If there is something extra, it would be ideal to find a way to get rid of it. If there is duplicative code, we can turn it into its function, and simplify the code.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  I take my time and figure out exactly what the user needs by going through the requirements and simplifying them into a way that makes sense to me. After which, I put it into a list, and start my game plan for how I will tackle the software. Either by designing a UML diagram, or creating a use case diagram so that I meet every requirement.

How do I approach designing software?

  I prefer to figure out requirements, then start at the base level of the program, and figure out exactly how I should be going about creating the program. As an example, if creating an interface for an ATM, I would start at the login screen, figure out what needs to be implemented, then figure out the next few options, and continue from there. Keeping in mind any areas where code might end up being duplicative and ensuring I keep track of that so I can simplify the code later.
